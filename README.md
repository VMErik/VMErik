- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VMErik
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding and meeting new development challenges with emerging technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile application development in Flutter. Integration with NodeJS and postgresSql

I like to practice with the different technologies that I know.
In this place you can find some of the basic test exercises that I have done and some others a little more advanced. ðŸ’»
